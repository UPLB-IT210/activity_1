  "q": "What is HTTP?",
  "a" : "HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, a set of rules used by computers for communication over the World Wide Web. This protocol allows the exchange of data between client and a web server via TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) within a period of time.\n\nConnecting to the server via this protocol is relatively straightforward using a browser. By placing “http://“ or ”https://“ at the beginning of the URL, a connection can be established and a request can then be made.  The image below illustrates how the protocol works in a typical client-server infrastructure.",
